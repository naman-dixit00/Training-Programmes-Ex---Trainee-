## Programs

### 1. NASA — Open Science 101 / Open Science Essentials  
**Summary:** Open Science 101 and Open Science Essentials are introductory courses from NASA that teach the principles and practical implementation of open science. The curriculum covers reproducible workflows, data management and sharing, open-source tooling, and practical strategies to plan and conduct open-science research. The courses are offered free of charge with online and in-person options, and they are intended for researchers, students, and practitioners who want to adopt transparent and reusable research practices. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

**Included in this repo:** course notes, project artifacts, and certificate (if applicable).

### 2. ISRO / IIRS — AI, ML & Python (e-Learning / Edusat outreach)  
**Summary:** The Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS), an outreach arm regularly collaborating with ISRO, provides short, focused courses on geospatial data processing, and AI/ML applications using Python. Typical course content includes foundations of AI/ML, application of machine learning to remote sensing and crop/landcover mapping, practical hands-on sessions using Python and geospatial toolkits, and assessments leading to a certificate of completion. Many such offerings are delivered as free five-day online courses via the IIRS e-learning and EDUSAT outreach programmes. (I completed the ISRO/IIRS offering through the EDUSAT/official registration channel.) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

**Included in this repo:** downloaded brochure, lecture notes, code notebooks, and certificate scan.

### 3. CERN — CERN–Solvay Education Programme / Online Course & Student Camps  
**Summary:** The CERN–Solvay Education Programme delivers a suite of education activities for high-school and early-career students and educators, including short online topical courses and selective residential student camps. The programme provides concise topical video modules, quizzes, and hands-on opportunities intended to introduce participants to concepts and experimental practice relevant to particle physics and large-scale research infrastructures. The programme combines online learning resources with on-site learning experiences at CERN for selected participants. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

**Included in this repo:** course summaries, completed quiz evidence, and participation certificate (if applicable).

### 4. Microsoft — Educator Programs (Microsoft Innovative Educator / Learn for Educators)  
**Summary:** Microsoft’s educator programmes (including Microsoft Innovative Educator / Microsoft Learn for Educators and related certification pathways) are professional development initiatives that support educators in integrating Microsoft technologies into pedagogy. Programmes provide learning pathways, classroom resources, and recognition (expert or certification badges) for educators who demonstrate competency with educational technology and curriculum integration. The offerings also include instructor materials, assessment vouchers, and community engagement opportunities for teacher leaders. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

**Included in this repo:** course completion evidence, training resources used, and any earned digital badges.
